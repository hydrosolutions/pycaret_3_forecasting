    "# I. Change Log\n",
    "- 2023-04-20: \n",
    "  - Initial version\n",
    "- 2023-04-23: \n",
    "  - Upgraded packages.\n",
    "- 2023-04-23: \n",
    "  - New MBP environment pycaret_310 (works)\n",
    "- 2023-05-25: \n",
    "  - Starting to add more features to the model. More precisely, we now have SCF for individual elevation bands in the catchment (see also https://hydrosolutions.users.earthengine.app/view/centralasia-snowcover-eb for the GEE app with which these data were produced)\n",
    "- 2023-05-25: \n",
    "  - new branch scf_eb which is now the development branch for the model with SCF for individual elevation bands.\n",
    "- 2023-05-29: \n",
    "  - updated data paths and integration of new data (swe). new MCair environment via\n",
    "  - conda create --name pycaret_air python=3.10.10\n",
    "  - pip install 'pycaret[full]' (Note: for reference, we can add the flag --upgrade to upgrade the package))\n",
    "  - This resulted in a Failed to build lightgbm error. This is fixed by installing the latest version of cmake as per: \n",
    "      brew install cmake libomp\n",
    "  - rerun the pip install 'pycaret[full]' command\n",
    "  - After then running into numpy problems, I had to uninstall and reinstall the latter and after a few more rounds of trials, I got there.\n",
    "- 2023-05-30: Integration of swe data. Added Data Wrangler Preview for better handling and exploring the datasets in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- 2023-05-31: \n",
    "  - remove fastai dependency (not needed for this model).\n",
    "  - various git related housekeeping tasks, i.e. finished scf_eb branch and merged into main. Working on dev branch now.\n",
    "  - starting to work on modeling related tasks. \n",
    "- 2023-06-01: \n",
    "  - different modeling tests for baseline models.\n",
    "  - add mean SCF and mean SWE averaged over all elevation bands as features.\n",
    "  - deleted all previous garbage code.\n",
    "- 2023-06-06:\n",
    "  - revamped modeling section and continuing to work on it. Time Series Model with Long Lag Features is working. Testing different forecasting horizons and model performance.\n",
    "  - running into an issue with external regressors. Whatever key I pass, the predictions are always the same. Filed a question on Slack.\n",
    "- 2023-06-07: \n",
    "  - working on a reproducible example for the external regressors issue.\n",
    "  - making data available on GitHub inside the pycaret_3 folder. \n",
    "  - made available are discharge of interest.\n",
    "  - stored ocean indices data in ./code/pycaret_3/data/ocean_indices. Note, all these data export is done from the lab_63_nested_modeltime RProject in the Govshut folder.\n",
    "  - time series models no longer working after add prophet package to environment and after updating anaconda (which is not a good idea!)\n",
    "  - Setting up new env pycaret_3_0_2 and installing prophet first with \n",
    "    -- conda install -c conda-forge prophet\n",
    "  and then continuing to install pycaret with\n",
    "    -- pip install 'pycaret[full]'\n",
    "- 2023-06-08: \n",
    "  - Create a quickstart Section to quickly load the final .csv data before the beginning of the modeling section.\n",
    "  - several further small improvements. \n",
    "  - Kicked out regression models. PyCaret 3.0.2 does have time series models that can do all in an automatized fashion so that we do not need to use regression models anymore (see https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/discussions/1760 for a discussion on this topic). In short, the regression module is for regression, the time series module is for time series.\n",
    "  - Added a new section on how to blend models.\n",
    "  - Added to the documentation in general.\n",
    "- 2023-06-09: \n",
    "  - further improvements and code clean up.\n",
    "  - Consistently kicking out all this transformation and back-transformation code. This is all done by pycaret now.\n",
    "  - Adding ChatGPT background information for the uninitiated reader and more context specific information. This can all serve as great learning material for the future for Central Asia Hydromet forecasting experts.\n",
    "  - Adding a generic experiment section. If MLFlow is really that useful in logging and tracking experiments, we should use it. That means, that we can just fiddle with a generic forecasting code block without having to copy and paste the whole code block again and again for all experiments. At least that is the thinking right now and the direction that I am pushing towards.\n",
    "  - Added new Model Experiments section.\n",
    "  - Added background information on MLflow (derived from a ChatGPT query).\n",
    "  - Greatly improved and streamlined Chapter 5.\n",
    "  - Added comparison of baseline time series model predictions and well performing model with external regressors.\n",
    "  - Added finalization of baseline time series model.\n",
    "  - Entirely removed baseline regression model.\n",
    "  - further clean up of code and documentation.\n",
    "  - starting to prepare a reproducible example of the issues in relation to forecasting. The idea here is to file this as an issue on GitHub.\n",
    "- 2023-06-12: \n",
    "  - preparing standalone Google COLAB notebook for issue filing on GitHub.\n",
    "  - Upload relevant experiment data to GitHub.\n",
    "  - Filed issue #3602 on GitHub. Check it out here: https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues/3602\n",
    "  - Another lead on how to properly use external regressors in time series forecasting in PyCaret is here: https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/issues/3548, especially the reply by @ngupta23. Take these comments into account!  \n",
    "  - Learned a great deal in the later post and will update the code accordingly. Maybe good to get a feeling of what that `WindowSummarizer` is exactly doing in a separate section (see https://gist.github.com/ngupta23/361d353ddd5e4b55c2f46d8fab6d4b44).\n",
    "- 2023-06-13:\n",
    "  - Check on this `WindowSummarizer` (see Section 2.4.alt).\n",
    "- 2023-06-14:\n",
    "  - Develop a model with the `WindowSummarizer`.\n",
    "  - Creating a backup and throwing out all baggage not needed anymore with future dataframe, lagged rolling variables, etc. Backup name: 2023_06_14_time_series_fc_101_pycaret_bu.ipynb\n",
    "- 2023-06-15:\n",
    "  - DagsHub integration. Repository name on dagshub is: tobiassiegfried/pycaret_3_forecasting. See also Moez Ali for more information here: https://www.moez.ai/2021/05/02/introduction-to-pycaret-for-beginners/ \n",
    "  - Started experiment logging.\n",
    "  - Trying to understand the workflow for model training and retraining once we gain more data over time. For a hint, see here: https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/discussions/2844 \n",
    "  - Merging to main before invitation of Bea to repo.\n",
    "  - just renamed the Jupyter Notebook to monthly_seasonal_fc.ipynb\n",
    "  - Trying to integrate naming conventions so that it actually is clear that this script is for monthly/seasonal predictions.\n",
    "- 2023-07-05:\n",
    "  - updated environment to pycaret 3.0.4\n",
    "    - conda create --name pycaret_3_0_4 python=3.10.10\n",
    "    - conda activate pycaret_3_0_4  \n",
    "    - conda install -c conda-forge prophet \n",

    "  - more work on the notebook.\n",
    "  - adding baseline models of all rivers.\n",
    "- 2023-08_10:\n",
    "  - adding sv index where sv is a proxy for snow volume. We note that standardizing and centering the swe and scf data that goes into the computation of sv is non-sensical as it can then turn out that 2 negative values get multiplied for a very large positive sv to emerge. We should standardize the indicies between 0 and 1 instead.."

    "# II. BACKGROUND \n",
    "\n",
    "## II.1 General Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some background on machine learning and time series forecasting in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Understand the Problem and Choose the Right Model:**\n",
    "Always begin by understanding the problem you're trying to solve. Is it a classification or a regression problem? Maybe it's a clustering problem. Understanding the problem helps you choose the right machine learning algorithm to apply. The \"No Free Lunch Theorem\" of machine learning suggests there's no one-size-fits-all algorithm, so picking the right one is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Preprocessing is Important:**\n",
    "Always clean your data before running it through an algorithm. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Normalization or standardization can be crucial for some algorithms. Feature engineering, including combining different features, is also often a helpful step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Split Your Data:**\n",
    "Split your data into training, validation, and testing sets. A common ratio is 70:15:15 or 80:10:10. This will help you avoid overfitting to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Build a Baseline Model:**\n",
    "Always start with a simple model to understand the problem's baseline performance. It gives you a benchmark against which you can compare the performance of more complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Gradually Increase Complexity:**\n",
    "Once your baseline model is performing satisfactorily, you can move to more complex models. This could mean using more complex algorithms, adding more features, or fine-tuning your model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Regularization and Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "Regularization methods such as Lasso and Ridge can help prevent overfitting. Also, consider using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize your model's hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Validate Your Model:**\n",
    "Check your model's performance on the validation set to make sure it generalizes well. Keep an eye on metrics relevant to your specific problem. For example, accuracy isn't always the best metric, especially for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Use Cross-Validation:**\n",
    "Cross-validation (e.g., K-fold cross-validation) is a good technique to ensure that your model is not fitting to specific artifacts in your data and generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Evaluate on Test Set:**\n",
    "Once you are satisfied with your model's performance on the validation set, evaluate it on the test set. This should give you an idea of how well your model will perform in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Keep the Model Up-to-Date:**\n",
    "Machine learning models often need to be retrained with new data to maintain their performance. Establish a schedule to periodically update your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Understand and Communicate Your Results:**\n",
    "Machine learning isn't just about building models; it's also about understanding and communicating your results. Make sure to spend time visualizing, interpreting, and communicating your results in a way that is understandable to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Ethical Considerations:**\n",
    "Always consider the ethical implications of your work. Be aware of potential biases in your data and the potential consequences of false positives or negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the goal is not to create the most complex model, but the simplest model that still performs well. \"Occam's razor\" is often quoted in machine learning: Given two explanations, the simpler one is usually better. It's not just about accuracy, but also interpretability, computational efficiency, and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II.2 Specific Considerations for our Context\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the latest version of the PyCaret low code machine learning library. For more information, see https://pycaret.org/. Specifically, we use the TimeSeries Module there which became available with version 3.0.0. This basically allows us to take care of most of the steps mentioned above (2,3,6,7,8,9,10) in a very efficient and automatized fashion and allows us to focus on the problem at hand and on how best to use our domain knowledge to improve the model.\n"

    "The Time Series Module is a dedicated for forecasting and includes a combination of statistical and regression based models. For regression based models in the time series module, the feature engineering is done automatically. This is a huge advantage as it saves a lot of time and effort in preparing the data for modeling when compared to the traditional regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information collected from various sources on the internet:\n",
    "\n",
    "PyCaret Time Series Forecasting module has a rich set of models ranging from traditional statistical models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, ETS, etc to 'Reduced Regression Models'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we can not use a regression model directly to build a forecasting model for data with temporal dependence (fancy term for time series data). In order to do so, we need to first convert the temporal data into a supervised learning problem with appropriate features. For the sake of this discussion, we will call his \"reduced regression\". An important concern during this process is to make sure that we do not leak information about any future (unavailable) data while performing this conversion. Another important concern here is the ability to do multi-step ahead forecasting using this approach. Since the data is formulated as a single step ahead supervised problem, performing multi-step ahead forecasting needs addition work which the modeler must take care of.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sktime library** provides a very convenient way to perform Time Series Forecasting using Reduced Regression models and PyCaret has incorporated the same into its time series module as well. However, there are some nuances that need to be taken into consideration when using these models. For example, since the Reduced Regression models do not have any notion of time, trends, and seasonality, it is often useful to deseasonalize and de-trend the data before performing the reduction, training and forecasting. This is analogous to modeling only the auto-regressive terms in the data which makes it easier to find a better fitting model since we are not relying on it to figure out seasonality and trend in addition to the auto-regressive properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is taken care of automatically in PyCaret using a pipeline which conditionally deseasonalizes (if seasonality is detected) and de-trends the data before fitting it. These models are represented with a suffix _cds_dt. The time series module currently supports almost 20 reduced regression models of various types (linear, decision trees, gradient boosted, nearest neighbors, etc)! The full list of models supported can be found below."

Sometimes, we can achieve even better results if we combine results of several good models. This can be achieved using the blend_model functionality.

The long lagged variables by their nature are already available in the future dataframe. So, we can pass these regressors to the predict_model() function without the need for them to be predicted themselves. Note that such situation is the exception rather than the rule.

    "\n",
    "Using PyCaret and MLflow together is a great way to simplify your machine learning workflow and keep track of your experiments. Here are some best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyCaret**\n",
    "- Data Preparation: PyCaret handles many preprocessing steps automatically, but it's still important to manually inspect and understand your data before feeding it into the pipeline. Especially for time series analysis, check for stationarity, autocorrelation, seasonality, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing the Right Model: PyCaret provides a variety of models you can choose from. You should experiment with different models, but remember the end goal: the simplest model that can do the job well is often the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand Defaults: PyCaret simplifies the modeling process by setting sensible defaults, but you should still understand what's going on under the hood. Make sure to study the documentation, so you can tweak the defaults when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Interpretability: PyCaret includes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) which can be a powerful tool for interpreting your model's predictions. However, always be careful when interpreting these types of model-agnostic explanations, as they can sometimes be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MLflow**\n",
    "- Logging Metrics: MLflow allows you to log not only model parameters but also custom metrics, artifacts (like plots or models), etc. Be consistent in what you log and how you name things to make it easier to compare experiments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Use Tags Wisely: Tags can be used to categorize your runs. You might use tags to denote different stages of experimentation, or different subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Version Control of Data and Models: MLflow integrates with many storage solutions and allows you to version control your data and models. This can be incredibly useful for reproducibility and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproducibility: Record enough information about your runs to make them reproducible. This includes information about the environment (e.g., library versions) and a detailed narrative of what you were trying to accomplish with each run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using PyCaret and MLflow Together**\n",
    "- Pipeline Integration: PyCaret's end-to-end pipelines are great for reproducibility and efficiency, and they integrate well with MLflow. Be sure to log the entire pipeline, not just the final model, to keep track of data preprocessing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Consistency Across Experiments: If you're logging PyCaret's automated experiments in MLflow, be consistent about how you log data, models, parameters, and metrics. Consistency will make it easier to compare models and understand your experiments in the future.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Be Selective: While it's possible to log a large amount of information about every run, it can sometimes be more effective to be selective about what you log. Focus on the information that's most useful for comparing models and diagnosing issues."
